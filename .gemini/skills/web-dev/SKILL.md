# Skill: Senior Web Development (React 19 & Tailwind 4)

## Stack
- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript (Strict Mode).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (Modern/Atomic).
- **Runtime:** Bun (preferred over Node.js for performance).
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture for UI components.

## Guidelines
- **Composition over Inheritance:** Use Higher-Order Components or Custom Hooks for logic reuse.
- **Performance:** Memoize expensive calculations. Use React Server Components (RSC) where possible.
- **Type Safety:** No `any`. Use `Zod` for runtime validation of API responses.
- **UX/UI:** Prioritize accessibility (ARIA) and Material Design principles.

## AI Instructions
- Always use the latest React 19 features (e.g., `use`, Action patterns).
- When suggesting CSS, use Tailwind 4 syntax.
- Ensure all components are unit-tested with Vitest or Playwright.
